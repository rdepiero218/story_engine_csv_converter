# Story Engine CSV Converter

This is a simple app to convert CSV files for [The Story Engine Webapp](https://cardcreator.storyenginedeck.com).

The required CSV format for The Story Engine Webapp to make new cards makes it a little hard to read and input data.

Now you can enter card information in columns in a CSV file and then upload the file to this converter to add the required formatting.
